# airbnb-clone-project
Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. 

"Team Roles"
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.

Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services. Even in Agile environments, development and operations teams can be siloed. DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.

QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards. The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. To verify both, QA specialists run various checks, followed by analyzing the test results and reporting on the application quality.

"Technology Stack"

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.

PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.

GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.

"Database Design"

Users:  book a room, users can make payments, and users can leave a review.  

Properties: property reviews, property bookings, payments for the property 

Bookings: checking users reviews,  confirming property status, making payments for your booking

Payments: make payments for your bookings, user payments details, booking and payment efficieny

Reviews:  users to leave reviews,  properties ratings based on reviews,reviews based on booking efficiency.

"Feature Breakdown"
